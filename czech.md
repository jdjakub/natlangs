Czech
=====

* **HOW**: Personal immersion, internet, Lonely Planet book
* **HOW LONG**: Since April 2024
* **WHY**: I now live in Prague for my postdoc, and only my age and younger speak English...

## A Unique Opportunity
Czech is the first language on my list I have a strong practical motivation to learn, because I now live there. It's like I'm on an immersion course for a year. This means some changes from my usual nerd orientation:

* Urgent need to communicate forces real-world vocab
* Surrounded by the language, can pick up words from e.g. signs
* Regular practice rather than studying it when the mood takes me

## Russian Not That Helpful
Sadly, knowing some Russian is not as helpful as I previously assumed. Sure, not being scared of cases helps, and the case and conjugation endings have many similarities. But the vocabulary is so different!

## Long Vowels
Every language has *something* with no obvious patterns that you just have to memorise. In Czech, this seems to be long vowels. I also have trouble pronouncing these in conjunction with the rule that stress goes on the first syllable.

More coming soon.
