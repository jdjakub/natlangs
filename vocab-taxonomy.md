Vocab by stage in human history:
- Foragers: $$$$$ - basic stuff like body parts, kinship rels, time/space, plants/animals/foods, sun/moon/stars, env
- Farmers: $$ - on the one hand, common agri products like flour / milk. On the other, think of how many English words I've never heard of turn out to be farming or seafaring-related. Back to the first hand though: a truly staggering number of metaphors and proverbs, at least in English.
- Medievals $ - not much useful vocab?
- Industrial Revolution $$$$ - frequent everyday reference to its products and metaphors. Including precise, absolute post-industrial time and space measures ("15:37" versus forager "afternoon")
- Modern Tech $$$$ - ditto
