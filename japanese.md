Japanese
========
* **HOW**: Whenever, on the Web. Translating cutscenes from Dissidia 012 Duodecim Final
  Fantasy. Early progress led to long flatline.
* **HOW LONG**: From 2011 at the very earliest, when that game came out. Also, I had
  researched Japan for a project at school, and I was like *whoooa, you mean it's nothing
  like Chinese at all and there are no scary tones? Let's do it!*
* **WHY**:
    - Very pleasant sounding language.
    - Beautiful, alien writing system (aesthetically... NOT design-wise)
    - Such a lot of culture exported from such a tiny island.
    - Wholesome to undo my lizard brain's associating it with cool and dramatic anime villain voices
    ... ahhh, never gonna happen.
    
Fun fact: I got the anime association mainly through that game, and osmosis. At the time of writing
I've never properly watched any---I think the sum total is the first episode of *Kill la Kill* and
the first few of *Evangelion*, but I never got into them for whatever reason. If we're not limited
to series, we can add *Your Name* and *Howl's Moving Castle*, but that's it. They're all great, I
agree, but --- 知ってらない.

# LUCKY MONKEY MEDIA ラキーモンキーメディア
First of all, let's get this chldhood earworm out of the way.

In the more joyful and innocent Web of the 2000s, there was an awesome Shockwave game by Lego called *Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident*. And one of the most memorable sounds of the whole game was a piece of Japanese that you can hear at the beginning of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHnNlfAywY0).

Ever since I started learning, it's been difficult for me to even parse the sounds into Japanese that I know. My best attempt is this:

> 警告: 現在アクセス[chu?]の[goingu? go-iku? ???]は、ラキーモンキーメディアの[chuu?]用地がある。[bujuka?]でのアクセスは、禁止されています。

> keikoku: genzai akusesu [chu?] no [go-iku?] wa, rakkī monkī mīdia no [chuu?] yōchi ga aru. [bujuka?] de no akusesu wa, kinshi sarete imasu.

> Warning: regarding the current access [go-iku?], there is the site of Lucky Monkey Media. The access of [bujuka?] is prohibited.

(Just for the hell of it, when I was a kid I always heard this: "...New York shyaa! Shook, I dunno, access wah; keen Saturday Mass!")

There were other messages, with warnings in other languages. The English one reads as follows, so at least we have a known target:

> Warning: the node you are attempting to access is the property of [company]. Unauthorized access beyond this point is strictly prohibited.
