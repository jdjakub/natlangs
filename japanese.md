Japanese
========
* **HOW**: Whenever, on the Web. Translating cutscenes from Dissidia 012 Duodecim Final
  Fantasy. Early progress led to long flatline.
* **HOW LONG**: From 2011 at the very earliest, when that game came out. Also, I had
  researched Japan for a project at school, and I was like *whoooa, you mean it's nothing
  like Chinese at all and there are no scary tones? Let's do it!*
* **WHY**:
    - Very pleasant sounding language.
    - Beautiful, alien writing system (aesthetically... NOT design-wise)
    - Such a lot of culture exported from such a tiny island.
    - Wholesome to undo my lizard brain's associating it with cool and dramatic anime villain voices
    ... ahhh, never gonna happen.
    
Fun fact: I got the anime association mainly through that game, and osmosis. At the time of writing
I've never properly watched any---I think the sum total is the first episode of *Kill la Kill* and
the first few of *Evangelion*, but I never got into them for whatever reason. If we're not limited
to series, we can add *Your Name* and *Howl's Moving Castle*, but that's it. They're all great, I
agree, but --- しってらない.
