Arabic
======

* **HOW**: Taking a beginner's course with Actual People, 2h every week.
* **HOW LONG**: < 1 year
* **WHY**:
    * Cool script
    * Cool phonology
    * Cool grammar (Semitic root system)
    * Wholesome to undo my lizard brain's associating it with ... *explosions*.

# Phonology
TLDR: Throat.

Q: What do you call an 3arab with a sore throat?  
A: Rab ;)

# Orthography
* Right-to-left (no computer, when I pressed Backspace, I meant---aaarrrrgh)
* Squiggly (but جميل jamīl!)

## Romanisation

| Squiggly | Arabish    | Full IPA  | Punk IPA (5.6%) | Mine       | Normie     | Meaning |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| الشارع   | al-shaari3 | aʃˈʃaːriʕ | aš-šāriʕ        | aš-šāri3   | ash-shAHre   | The street |

| قرآن     | qur'aan    | qurˈʔaːn  | qurʔān          | qur'ān     | KORAN ಠ_ಠ    | That which is read...? |

I think that covers the major letters.

Gonna use romanisation ("mine") for most of this, cus I haven't set up a decent IME yet.

\* If I omit the asterisk, something weird happens with text rendering :/

# Diglossia & Dialects
And plenty of them. الحمدلله alḥamdulillah... (do they use this sarcastically?)

We seem to be learning Modern Standard Arabic, but without the case markers.

# Grammar

# Gender
ت *taa'* has a *strong feminine scent* to it. (See: verbs)

# Number
* They've got a freakin' DUAL
* *jam3 taksīr* "Broken plurals", many/few-type plurals, O_O
    - Favourite pattern is CāCiCah --> CawāCiC
        + 3āṣimah --> 3awāṣim (capitol/s)
        + 3ā'ilah --> 3awā'il (family/ies)
        + mā'idah --> mawā'id (dining table/s)
        + qā'imah --> qawā'im (list/s)
    - Second favourite is CvCC ---> CuCūC
        + qalb --> qulūb (heart/s)
        + ra's --> ru'ūs (head/s)
        + 3ayn --> 3uyūn (eye/s) (dual 3aynā)
        + 3ilm --> 3ulūm (science/s)
    
## Verbs
OK. Information compression time.

Example: ك ت ب k-t-b- (to write)

### 1st-person (I, we)
Simple, sounds like the pronoun.

* **a**nā **a**ktubu, **na**ḥnu **na**ktubu.

### 2nd-person (You...)
#### Prefix
All suspiciously start with the ت *taa'* from the end of an**ta**.

* an**t•••** **ta**ktub•••

#### Suffix
Masculine follows -ān(i), -ūn(a) i.e. same "sound" dual/plural as with nouns.

* ant**a** taktubu, ant**umā** taktub**ān**, ant**um** taktub**ūn**.

Feminine is special with the *one-off* an**ti** ...-īn(a), and the plural antu**nna** ...-na.

* ant**i** taktub-**īn**, antu**nna** taktub**na**.

### 3rd-person (He, she, they)
Easy: masculine prefix in ya-, feminine in ta- (same dots, different place!).

Same suffixes as 2nd person except -īn (I said it was a one-off).

* hu**wa**, hu**mā** (M), h**um** **ya**ktub(u / ān / ūn)
* hi**ya**, hu**mā** (F), h**unna** **ta**ktub(u / ān / na)

Notice the gendered dual *(y/t)aktubān*, but keep in mind the usual mixed = masculine.

## Ambiguity warning!
Yes, you are correct, *taktubu* on its own might mean *you write* or *she writes*. And *taktubna* can mean *you girls write"* or, *ya3niyy*, *them girls write*. Stick a pronoun in front if that helps you sleep at night.

## Summary
a- means ME, na- means WE,  ya- means HE and ta- means YOU ... (or SHE!)

-ān means TWAIN, -ūn means THE LADS, -na means LADIES and -īn means ... "M'LADY" (\*tips headdress\*)

And -u can mean YOU, HUMAN ... or SHE.

## Summary table
Not as scary as some other tables I've seen.

| Who | Writes |
| ----|--------|
| naḥnu / anā | (n)aktubu
| anta/i | takubu/īn
| huwa/hiya | (y/t)aktubu
| antumā | taktubān
| humā | (y/t)aktubān
| antum | taktubūn
| hum | yaktubūn
| ant/hunna | (t/y)aktubna*

\* NB Our teacher taught us *hunna taktubna* yet Wiktionary says *yaktubna*. He's a native speaker so I'd be surprised if it's wrong---local variation?
