Arabic
======

* **HOW**: Took a beginner's course with Actual People, 2h every week.
* **HOW LONG**: 6 months
* **WHY**:
    * Cool script
    * Cool phonology
    * Cool grammar (Semitic root system)
    * Wholesome to undo my lizard brain's associating it with ... *explosions*.

# Phonology
TLDR: Throat.

Q: What do you call an 3arab with a sore throat?  
A: Rab ;)

## An Arabic throat-twister I came up with
I watch the Arabs, with my own eyes, on the street on a Wednesday in spring!

أعاين العرب مع عيناى على الشارع الأربعاء في الربيع

*u3āyin al-3arab ma3a 3aynāya 3alā aš-šāri3 al-arbi3ā' fī-r-rabī3!*

# Orthography
* Right-to-left (no computer, when I pressed Backspace, I meant---aaarrrrgh)
* Squiggly (but جميل jamīl!)

## Romanisation

I think that covers the major letters.

Gonna use romanisation ("mine") for most of this. I have now set up an IME, but the GitHub eidtor doesn't seem to like bidirectional text in some circumstances, e.g.

\* If I omit the asterisk, something weird happens with text rendering :/

# Diglossia & Dialects
And plenty of them. الحمدلله alḥamdulillah... (do they use this sarcastically?)

We seem to be learning Modern Standard Arabic, but without the case markers.

# Grammar

## Gender
ت *taa'* has a *strong feminine scent* to it. (See: verbs)

While the masculine (as in several languages, oddly enough...) is characterised by consonant endings (at least in nouns).

## Number
* There is singular...
    - mudarris (male teacher)
    - mudarris**ah** (female teacher)
* They've got a freakin' DUAL as a suffix that usually sounds like *-ān* for both genders
    - mudarrisān (two male teachers)
    - mudarrisatān (two female teachers)
* Plurals can be "simple" or "sound" plurals, often with agent/people words. Masc *-ūn*, fem *-āt*
    - mudarrisūn (many teachers)
    - mudarrisāt (many specifically female teachers)
    
However, every language seems to have *some* large set of grammar you have to "just learn" ... and Arabic's answer to that is...

### BROKEN PLURALS (*jam3 taksīr*)
- Either used for non-humans, or have a "many" rather than "small amount" meaning...?
- Favourite pattern is CāCiCah --> CawāCiC
    + 3āṣimah --> 3awāṣim (capitol/s)
    + 3ā'ilah --> 3awā'il (family/ies)
    + mā'idah --> mawā'id (dining table/s)
    + qā'imah --> qawā'im (list/s)
    + fākihah --> fawākih (fruit/s)
- Second favourite is CvCC ---> CuCūC
    + qalb --> qulūb (heart/s)
    + ra's --> ru'ūs (head/s)
    + 3ayn --> 3uyūn (eye/s) (dual 3aynā)
    + 3ilm --> 3ulūm (science/s)
- Many patterns... CaCaC / CvCC ---> aCCāC
    + walad ---> awlād (boy/s)
    + qalam ---> aqlām (pen/s)
    + ṭabaq ---> aṭbāq (plate/s)
    + yawm ---> ayyām (day/s)
    + ḥulm ---> aḥlām (dream/s)
    + rub3 ---> arbā3 (quarter/s)

### Actual numbers
In Arabic, even something as child-like as counting forces you to accept the sheer frequency of *3ayn* in the language!

1. wāḥid(ah)
2. iθn(at)ān (which itself sounds like a dual)
3. θalāθ(ah)
4. arba3(ah)
5. ḳams(ah)
6. sitt(ah)
7. sab3(ah)
8. θamāniyy(ah)
9. tis3(ah)
10. 3ašar(ah)

Not only that, but when counting *things* there is really strange pair of gender/place swaps.

In singular and dual, genders match and the number comes second:
- kalb wāḥid "one dog", tuffaḥ**ah** wāḥid**ah** "one apple"
- kalbān iθnān "two dogs", tuffaḥ**at**ān iθn**at**ān "two apples"

But---get this---in **plural** (3+), both position **and gender** REVERSE(!)
- kilāb θalāθ? *WRONG!*
- θalāθ kilāb? *WRONG!*
- θalāθ**ah** kilāb "three dogs"
- θalāθ tuffaḥāt "three apples"

I can sorta understand how the place-switch could evolve, but the gender-switch defies explanation.

## Pronouns
Unique *anā / naḥnu* for I/WE. (Colloquially, *naḥnu* --> similar-sounding *aḥna*.)

Prefix ant- for 2nd person, h- for 3rd person.

Singular *anta / anti* YOU (M/F), *huwa* HE, *hiya* SHE.

Suffix -umā for dual, -um / -unna for M / F plural. (As is often the case, mixed = masculine.)

So: *antumā / humā* for YOU BOTH / THEY BOTH, *antum / hum* for Y'ALL / THEY, and ...

*antunna / hunna* for (AHEM) LADIES...?

### Clitic pronouns
Instead of "my dog", "her dog"---Arabs say "dog-my", "dog-her" using shortened suffix pronouns.

* 1st person is -iyy MY, -unā OUR. Thus *kalbiyy* "my dog", *kalbunā* "our dog".
* 2nd person is unchanged but with k- instead of ant-. *kalbuki* "Your(F) dog", *kalbukumā* "Your(2) dog".
* 3rd person is unchanged except for *huwa* --> -hu, *hiya* --> -hā. *kalbuhā* "her dog", *kalbuhum* "their dog".

(**anta** m3allem, wa-**aḥna**, min**ka** net3allem---"**u** da boss and **from u** we learn" lol)

Further, these seem to be how you express a direct object in a verb (next section). E.g.
- uḥibbu**ki** "I love you(F)"
- yuḥibbu**hā** "he loves her"
- Insert an n: tuḥibbu**niyy** "You love me"
    
# Verbs
OK. Information compression time.

Example: ك ت ب k-t-b- (to write)

## Present / non-past tense

### 1st-person (I, we)
Simple, sounds like the pronoun.

* **a**nā **a**ktubu, **na**ḥnu **na**ktubu.

### 2nd-person (You...)
#### Prefix
All suspiciously start with the ت *taa'* from the end of an**ta**.

* an**t•••** **ta**ktub•••

#### Suffix
Masculine follows -ān(i), -ūn(a) i.e. same "sound" dual/plural as with nouns.

* ant**a** taktubu, ant**umā** taktub**ān**, ant**um** taktub**ūn**.

Feminine is special with the *one-off* an**ti** ...-īn(a), and the plural antu**nna** ...-na.

* ant**i** taktub-**īn**, antu**nna** taktub**na**.

### 3rd-person (He, she, they)
Easy: masculine prefix in ya-, feminine in ta- (same dots, different place!).

Same suffixes as 2nd person except -īn (I said it was a one-off).

* hu**wa**, hu**mā** (M), h**um** **ya**ktub(u / ān / ūn)
* hi**ya**, hu**mā** (F), h**unna** **ta**ktub(u / ān / na)

Notice the gendered dual *(y/t)aktubān*, but keep in mind the usual mixed = masculine.

## Ambiguity warning!
Yes, you are correct, *taktubu* on its own might mean *you write* or *she writes*. And *taktubna* can mean *you girls write"* or, *ya3niyy*, *them girls write*. Stick a pronoun in front if that helps you sleep at night.

## Summary
a- means ME, na- means WE,  ya- means HE and ta- means YOU ... (or SHE!)

-ān means TWAIN, -ūn means THE LADS, -na means LADIES and -īn means ... "M'LADY" (\**tips headdress*\*)

And -u can mean YOU, HUMAN ... or SHE.

## Summary table
Not as scary as some other tables I've seen.

| Who | Writes |
| ----|--------|
| naḥnu / anā | (n)aktubu
| anta/i | takubu/īn
| huwa/hiya | (y/t)aktubu
| antumā | taktubān
| humā | (y/t)aktubān
| antum | taktubūn
| hum | yaktubūn
| ant/hunna | (t/y)aktubna*

\* NB Our teacher taught us *hunna taktubna* yet Wiktionary says *yaktubna*. He's a native speaker so I'd be surprised if it's wrong---local variation?

## Past tense (al-fi3l al-māḍī - try saying that with a ball gag in your mouth)

In the dictionary, the verb *k-t-b-* is listed as *kataba*, usually translated as "to write". However, this actually means "he wrote", and the rest of the past forms are derived from it.

### 3rd Person

The *t*- sound is feminine, so:

* huwa kataba *"he wrote"*
* hiya kataba**t** *"she wrote"*

Elsewhere, the dual normally ends in -ān; in the past, looks like the final n has been dropped. So

* kataba --> humā katabā *"them two (MM/MF) wrote"*
* katabat --> humā katabatā *"them two (FF) wrote"*

Similarly, the masculine plural, normally -ūn, is now just -ū, but it's written with alif after the waw (lost "tanween"?)

* hum katabū (written كتبوا with alif) *"they (masc/mixed) wrote"*
* hunna katabna (similar to the present *hunna t/yaktubna)* *"THEM GURRRLZ wrote"*

### 2nd Person

Dead easy - just *kataba* suffixed with the shortened pronoun. *anXXX katabXXX*.

* an**ta** katab**ta**, an**ti** katab**ti**, an**tumā** katab**tumā**
* an**tum** katab**tum**, an**tunna** katab**tunna**

### 1st Person

* Singular is similar to *anta, anti*, and uses up the remaining vowel *u*. *anā katab**tu***.
* Plural adds *nā* to the end: *naḥnu katab**nā***. A lengthened version of *hunna katabna*. So if you're gonna drop the pronouns in MSA, I guess it's critical that you make the vowel length clear.
