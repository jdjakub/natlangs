Russian
=======

* **HOW**: Whenever, on the Web. Which is why initial progress was fast, but soon flatlined.
* **HOW LONG**: since ~2013, so 7 years.
* **WHY**:
    * Krazy Kool lettarz
    * Sounds cool when the baddies speak it in movies and games
    * Maybe read Russian lit one day?
    * Wholesome to undo my lizard brain's associating it with **☭К☭О☭М☭М☭У☭Н☭И☭З☭М☭**.
