I want a systematic approach for learning which things in which order, when learning a new language. It has to fit the philosophical aesthetics of the way my mind works, for which I simply can't give a closed-form description.

The standard language-class / textbook approach annoys me: what's the point of knowing the names of all the different transportation vehicles, if I still can't say "if ... then"...!

I want to get the most bang for my buck in terms of time invested. Such an approach might differ heavily from standard approaches in the first ~10 hours of learning; by the 100th hour, they might not differ much at all.

Put another way: the first chapter of a textbook is often "high-urgency", e.g. greetings, thank you, and very basic grammar. But Chapter 2 is then about "going to the movies" or something equally specific. My point is that I would rather Chapter 2 and 3 and 4 etc. be about *further grammar,* or in line with the rest of the principles in this document.

# Overall Goal: Sort By Urgency
Something like: the very first few words / grammar I learn at the beginning (or even whether to focus on the writing system vs pronunciation vs listening) should somehow be *maximally useful*. I want to learn all the "important" or "more frequent" or "more useful" things first, and the rest later. Abstractly, some "urgentness" metric is computed for each "atom of learning", we sort them all from most urgent to least urgent, then I learn them in that order.

In other words: I never want to feel annoyed that I've learned some obscure word just to understand an unusual sentence that I was unlucky enough to encounter, when I could have spent that time on something more useful instead.

Inspiration: KanjiDamage [complains very entertainingly](https://www.kanjidamage.com/kanji_facts#:~:text=THE%20TERRIBLE%20SECRET) about how scary-looking kanji are often for very common words, while the simplest-looking kanji end up meaning something like "a garrison of 17th century troops under the command of a Shogun", or "cinnabar" (which turns out to be a mineral, not a spice as I first guessed.)

>  I combined those two sets, and then I threw out all the bullshit ones where the meaning sounds like a crossword puzzle clue ('deep sea life form' or '17th century sulphur refining component') ([source](https://www.kanjidamage.com/introduction#:~:text=EXAMPLES%20OF%20REGULAR%20TEXTBOOKS%20MAKING%20SHIT%20HARDER))

# Atoms to build molecules
Speaking of KanjiDamage, one genius feature of his approach is to introduce all radicals before they are encountered. This is in some tension with "urgency": there might be a very urgent kanji to know, but one would need to learn it *before* one of its component kanji, which isn't very bottom-up. More generally, when thinking about grammatical forms which combine with various types of words, it seems sensible to prioritise forms that "unlock more things to say" before forms that only let you say a few things. For example, the English -er/-est adjective endings would dominate most adjectives in terms of urgency, although some common adjectives would justifiably come before them in the learning order (e.g. good/bad).

# Problem: urgency for what?
The problem with my dream is that "urgency" is incomplete. No matter how much I want there to just be a single definition, I must admit that it does not work that way: urgency depends on things I might know, or expect, about the *situations I will encounter and the language I will need to use*. Examples of different domains: watching media, reading internet writing, visiting a country, living/working in a country, making conversation with stranger, making conversation with loved one, understanding friends' conversation, understanding official announcement at airport, etc. These all break down fractally: e.g. if I know a movie is sci-fi, I expect to encounter more scientific jargon that I probably don't already know.

Despite this fractal structure of domains, branches of the tree all have common structure: without the copula, or however one says "X is Y" in a language, you'll probably be at a serious disadvantage in *any* domain. Most closed-class words/grammar would count for this; the various domains mostly concern open-class vocab. 

Urgency is not *just* "severity" or "importance". *Given* that I'm in a rare event, like an earthquake or a crime or an illness, certain vocab will suddenly become very urgent, but this is modulated by the rarity of those events in the first place (so it's about the relative "expected utility" of the learning-atoms, not the (dis)utility per se).

Nor is urgency just "frequency". A frequent word might come later in the ordering than a less-frequent word that is more useful (combines with more forms, has more meanings, etc - although that suggests an ordering of *word senses* rather than just words)

Urgency is approximately some sort of product of severity, frequency, and usefulness.

# Weight listening skills higher by default
But perhaps Urgency also depends on *hardness:* e.g. my weak point in all languages, no matter how well I may appear to speak them, is *listening* (even in my native English...). Reading is cheating: you can look back at any word for an extended period of time and gradually understand it. Even speaking is cheating: you know exactly which words you're intending to say. Listening requires segmenting someone else's phonemes into actual words, then understanding the words, in real time with limited memory and no rewind! Because it's so hard, and requires interacting with people or at least finding media to listen to (which might be about complex/over-specialised domains e.g. the current geopolitics of the nation, with no vocab I'll be using anytime soon), I always neglect this skill. As a result, people are impressed with my pronunciation, and then excitedly talk to me, and I'm just stuck saying "please speak more slowly" (they never do) and then "uh sorry do you speak English?". It's getting very tiresome and it's all because reading/writing are much more 
convenient than listening.

# Reading the script is more urgent than understanding it
Getting past exotic orthography, to the point where you can romanise it or pronounce it, is a relatively small investment with large gains early on in the process. Obviously, not a lot of time can pass between reading a script and understanding the words, but it seems like a wise thing to compete with other highly-urgent items (like grammar) and unlocks a lot of resources (i.e. all written material in the language).

# Closed-class is more urgent than open-class
Not knowing the word for something is a much easier problem than not knowing "how to say it" because it's a grammatical construct in your native tongue. Most of a language's closed-class / structural / grammar words (and patterns of words, or rules for conjugation etc) are highly urgent for the beginning of study. It's useless to know 1000 nouns with no way to use them except like a baby pointing at things.

At the same time, it would be a mistake to learn most of the grammar without even the top 10 most urgent open-class words. "Water", "excuse me", and "English" seem pretty urgent. However, it is probably not even *possible* to learn grammar without accidentally picking up the vocab used in the grammar examples anyway. My point is that, the closer to the beginning these examples are, the more urgent should be the open-class words that fill the grammatical holes.

# Exploit the natives for their lucrative ostensive definitions
If you expect to have native speakers handy, is there really any point learning e.g. all the colour words or names of plants/animals/foods on your own? If you just learn the words for the *classes* "colour", "plant", "animal", etc, along with the structures for asking "What X is this?" / "What is this X called?", then you can just point to something and learn it "on the job". What you *can't* do is ask "what abstract semantical class is this?", and point to the concept "colour"! So for anything one can point to or exhibit an example of, maybe just learn the name for its class so you can absorb its constituents while using the language.

More generally: anything you can learn "from experience" in the local context of use, postpone to the actual context of use. For the initial period of self-study, absorb the machinery you will need in order to gather further information from that environment.

# Exploit Google Translate
I will almost always have the Google Translate app available from my phone, whether online or with offline translation prepared ahead of time. This frees me up, in many cases, to learn a word precisely when I need it. Ability to read the script is critical if it doesn't yet have good romanisation (e.g. its Thai romanisation is just the [ISO-11940 transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11940) hence useless for pronouncing). One challenge is that it's not an oracle the way a native speaker is: frequently it selects word senses that aren't quite what you mean, or translates to words that don't suit the context. This can be mitigated somewhat by quickly thinking of an example sentence and deducing which part of its translation must be the word you want. This also works for closed-class words or grammatical patterns. 

# Escape English-dependence at the earliest opportunity
I must begin by learning the language in English, with English explanations of grammar and English word translations. It would be nice to wean myself off English as soon as reasonably possible. This means that language bootstrapping-related words, like "word", "translation", "explanation", "am I pronouncing this correctly?", "please speak more slowly" etc. are more urgent than they would be otherwise.

It's interesting to consider what the minimal grammar and vocab would be to allow one to learn the rest of the language from further immersion alone.
