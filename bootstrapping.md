# Natural language *bootstrapping*

CONTEXT: I have been enamoured with "bootstrapping" for some time from Ian Piumarta's VPRI work.
Some nice person took the time to explain [COLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLA_(software_architecture))
on Wikipedia, and they used a fascinating analogy (emphasis mine):

> To define the whole of English for someone who speaks a foreign language would be a monumental task,
> especially since it would have to be done over and over again for each foreign language we're coming
> from. However, we could instead define a **simpler subset of English** as a base which is just expressive
> enough to **understand definitions given in English**. For example, such a subset would not need a word
> for "giraffe", since it could be added later with a statement like "A giraffe is a herbivore with a
> long neck." Similarly the definitions of herbivore, neck and long can be added later with other
> statements, and so on. This way we can remove every part of English which we do not need in our subset.
>
> The bits we keep are **those which are needed to understand definitions and statements** (so that we can
> expand the language later), along with everything needed to **define** those, and so on. What we end up
> with is a **self-contained language, written in itself** (a subset of English) and capable of being
> expanded with statements like the giraffe one above.
>
> Any English speaker is thus capable of changing the language itself as easily as they speak (since
> it is defined in English) by rewriting, overriding or bypassing the statements given in the base,
> turning the language into anything (including existing ones). 
>
> Also, anyone can become an English speaker simply by **having this base translated** into their native
> tongue (a more tractable problem than translating the whole of English). Once they know this subset
> then they know enough English to understand other statements like the giraffe one, and thus grow their
> knowledge to the whole language **through English sentences** (which can be reused by everyone, regardless
> of their first language). This is analogous to the bootstrapping and compatibility of a COLA.

Question is, can this actually work? (It's not quite how anyone learns their native language...)

Well, I've had a hobbyist interest in several languages for years. And
I've done nearly all my learning online with free materials, because convenience is king when you're just
doing something for fun. In particular, English Wiktionary is usually very good. But sometimes, it
doesn't have the, say, Russian word I'm looking for. Yet down the side, I see a link to the Русский Wiktionary.
When I click it, I see that they have written an awful lot about the word with lots of examples!

Unfortunately, I don't know the words they use to explain the word!

But what if I did...? Surely the recursion must end somewhere? Let's see if language bootstrapping is a thing.

Good luck Googling this concept... although I wrote this, so it's something.

BOOTSTRAPPING: Starting from somewhere (e.g. English), acquire the new knowledge (e.g. French), **always doing
as much as possible in the target domain** (French). Always feed back improvement *in* French, to the ability to
learn French (in French).

PROBLEM: Two very distinct paths:
* "Spoken", immersed; as a **child** learns his or her native tongue. Requires actually *living*
  the language and talking to *real people* (gasp) and awkwardly struggling to express things (gasp!)
* "Literary", formal: one expects to find the best descriptions of English grammar in English, Russian in
  Russian, etc. Often, the categories / ontology of the grammar were invented by the *native* community, and merely
  *translated* or *calqued* by foreigners. (How else do we get trippy words like "Irrealis", "Aorist",
  "Basic Broken Plural Triptote"...?) This is the approach suggested by "start from VikiSlovar and go from there".
