# The benefits of thousands of years of meaning generation
Be inspired by the Digital Age! Our submission contains a concise explanation of our calculus of objects and computation. We decided to index by name and maintain the data structure. We multiply the camera matrix by the projection matrix and prepare for display.

# What the Ancients might see when the TARDIS translates our textbooks
Be made to breathe in by the Age of Fingers! That which we send under holds together a cut-together out-folding of our little stones for thrown-againsts and reckoning together. We cut apart to point by name and hold by hand the building of the Givens. We many-fold the womb of the room with that of throwing ahead and arrange before to fold it all apart.

(Sycorax Strong! Sycorax Mighty! Sycorax Rock!!)
